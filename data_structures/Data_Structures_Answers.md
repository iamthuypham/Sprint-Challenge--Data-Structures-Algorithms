Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method? O(V) with V is number of vertices

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function? O(V) with V is number of vertices

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? O(V) with V is number of vertices

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? O(V) with V is number of vertices

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function? O(nlogn). Iterate each node (O(n)) and delete that node (sift-down: O(logn))

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
O(n)
